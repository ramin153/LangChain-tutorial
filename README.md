# A lang chain tutorail


I am embarking on my journey to learn LangChain, and as I progress, I will be sharing Jupyter notebooks containing my code, accompanied by detailed explanations.

I am undertaking this effort for two reasons:
1. I couldn't find any comprehensive tutorials on the subject.
2. I believe that the best way to learn something is by teaching it to others.


I would be grateful if you could share my notebooks and provide corrections if I am mistaken on any subject.

This tutorial is also sponsored by FANAP's Advanced Technologies Lab (ZLab).
